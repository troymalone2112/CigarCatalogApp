# Background Image Setup Instructions

## To add the cigar collection background image:

1. **Save the cigar collection image** you shared to:
   ```
   /Users/troymalone/CigarCatalogApp/assets/cigar-collection-bg.jpg
   ```

2. **The image should be the one showing** the row of cigars with various bands including:
   - San Cristobal
   - Partagas
   - A.J. Fernandez
   - Hoyo de Monterrey
   - Cohiba
   - Romeo y Julieta
   - Montecristo
   - H. Upmann

3. **Once saved**, the app will automatically use it as the background for the home screen hero section.

## Current Design Features:
- ✅ Background image with 30% opacity
- ✅ Dark brown overlay (85% opacity) for text readability
- ✅ All text remains clearly visible
- ✅ Maintains the elegant cigar theme

## Alternative if image doesn't work:
If you encounter any issues with the image, you can:
1. Use any high-quality cigar collection photo
2. Name it `cigar-collection-bg.jpg`
3. Place it in the `assets/` folder

The design will automatically adapt to show your cigar collection as the beautiful background!
