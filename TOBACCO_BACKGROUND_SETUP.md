# Tobacco Leaf Background Setup Instructions

## To add the tobacco leaf background image:

1. **Save the tobacco leaf image** you shared to:
   ```
   /Users/troymalone/CigarCatalogApp/assets/tobacco-leaves-bg.jpg
   ```

2. **The image should be** the beautiful golden tobacco leaves with detailed vein patterns.

3. **Once saved**, the app will automatically use it as a subtle background for the main content sections.

## Design Implementation:
- ✅ Very low opacity (10-15%) so it doesn't interfere with text
- ✅ Only applied to main content areas (not header/footer)
- ✅ Complements the blue theme with warm golden undertones
- ✅ Creates elegant tobacco-themed atmosphere

The tobacco leaves will add a sophisticated, authentic cigar industry feel to your app!
