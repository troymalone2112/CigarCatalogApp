Today, the Alphabet Series includes many sizes, making it a brand within a brand, but the Serie P No. 2 got our attention. It's marketed by Habanos as one of Cuba's more full-bodied cigars. While we didn't find it particularly strong, the Serie P No. 2 was beautifully balanced and complex showing a precise palate of nutmeg, maple syrup, fresh coconut and cured tobacco—a honey-like note that you can smell in a barn when the leaves are nearly done curing. Luckily, this cigar is among the easier Cubans to find around the world and is offered in different formats: three-packs, 10-count boxes and standard boxes of 25.",Medium,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/partagas-serie-p-no-2-2023,,,,,,,,

Alec Bradley,Prensado Torpedo,95,$14.15,"Alec Bradley Prensado became famous when the Churchill size was named the cigar of the year back in 2011. It could be said that this was the cigar that put Alec Bradley on the map. But the accolade had an unexpected consequence and the company had to deal with a level of demand it didn't necessarily know how to handle. For a brief period, Prensado suffered quality issues as Alec Bradley struggled to meet demand. Alan Rubin, who owned the company at the time, vowed to correct the problems and doubled down on quality control. Now, more than 10 years later, it's a fantastic cigar and regained its rightful place as one of the best of the year. The blend of Nicaraguan and Honduran tobacco is still the same, however, Alec Bradley was acquired by Scandinavian Tobacco Group in February 2023.

La Aroma de Cuba,Mi Amor Belicoso,95,$9.25,"La Aroma de Cuba is one of Ashton's over-achievers. Made in Nicaragua by the Garcia family, the cigar is not only consistently excellent, it delivers tremendous value, offering a smoking experience that goes well above its suggested retail price. Ashton introduced the La Aroma de Cuba brand in 2003. Back then, it was made in Honduras. In 2009, Ashton Distributors turned production over to the Garcias and launched Mi Amor the following year, which was the brand's first line extension. Mi Amor was new territory for Ashton, as it represented the first time the company sold a cigar with a Mexican wrapper. The rest of the tobacco is Nicaraguan and grown by the Garcias on their many farms throughout the country's fertile regions. Like all La Aromas, Mi Amor is produced at the Garcias' My Father Cigars factory, and rolled with two binders—one of the factory's Cubanesque styles of construction. The blend is quite robust, but the Belicoso's tapered head makes the smoke a bit more concentrated, bringing the cigar's character into sharper focus. It's a rich smoke of malted chocolate and mixed nuts, leaving sweet and savory impressions that envelop the palate and resonate on the long finish.",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/la-aroma-de-cuba-mi-amor-belicoso-2023,,,,,,,,
El Pulpo,Belicoso Grande,94,$17.00,"El Pulpo is one of the newest cigars on this list, as it was released in 2023 by Artesano del Tobacco. It impressed us with its dense and powerful character. The cigar is made by A.J. Fernandez in Nicaragua with a Mexican San Andrés wrapper that the company says is aged for a longer period of time than is typical of Mexican wrappers. This is one of the reasons the brand took so long to come to market. When the wrapper was finally ready, the result was a big, bold cigar that also showed balance and purpose. It isn't strong just for the sake of being strong, but offers layers of coffee bean, dark chocolate, nuts and citrus that make a lasting statement. The cigars come from brothers Gus and Billy Fakih, former New York City cigar-shop owners who left retail to become full-time brand owners. Their first line, Viva La Vida, has appeared on our Top 25 list before. El Pulpo brought them to the next level. The name translates to the octopus"" in Spanish because the tendrils of smoke are supposed to surround your palate the way an octopus grabs its prey. It's a novel way of describing the smoking experience and one that we don't disagree with.""",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/el-pulpo-belicoso-grande-2023,,,,,,,,
Romeo y Julieta,Línea de Oro Hidalgos,94,$61.10,"The Cuban Romeo y Julieta Línea de Oro line is the super-premium extension of the core Romeo brand, much the way Behike is to Cohiba or the Línea 1935 is to Montecristo. To indicate its upper-echelon exclusivity in the Cuban portfolio, Habanos dressed the cigars in ornate, holographic bands and packaged them in gleaming boxes made of lacquered red sycamore. But the cigar isn't just about pageantry or inflated prices.

It may not be the most popular size in the line, but it was the most memorable this year and a shape that best showcases the dark Ecuador Sumatra wrapper.

Edición Diamante consists of Nicaraguan tobaccos, featuring a wrapper from a hybrid Cuban-seed plant grown in Jalapa.

Olmec is named after the ancient Mesoamerican people who occupied the area in Mexico where tobacco is grown today. That same tobacco is what defines the Olmec series, as the cigars are wrapped in Mexican cover leaf. Made in Nicaragua by A.J. Fernandez, Olmec comes in two wrapper types, Maduro and Claro (the Claro being slightly lighter). We found outstanding balance in the Claro Corona Gorda, which delivers a dense, sweet-and-spicy smoke.

What can we say other than this is one of the most consistent lanceros on the market. And one of the tastiest. Besides the wrapper, all the tobacco in this lancero was grown on brand owner Litto Gomez's La Canela farm in the Dominican Republic. The dry, hot microclimate makes his tobaccos strong and concentrated—and this cigar is all about concentration. The thin ring gauge condenses the smoke of each puff, putting an earthy, peppery smoke right in the center of the palate before notes of dark fruit, cocoa powder and leather blossom onto the long finish.",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/la-flor-dominicana-double-ligero-lancero-2023,,,,,,,,

He parted ways with his first manufacturer before ending up with Ernesto Perez-Carrillo, who now makes Bosphorus in the Dominican Republic. It's named after the Bosphorus Strait in Turkey, which speaks to Ozgener's Turkish heritage.

By Cuban standards, it's also a tremendous bargain, smoking well above its price tag. Few handmade Cubans retail for so little. Rafael Gonzalez may not have the recognition of the larger brands, but this cigar is every bit as worthy of being part of the conversation, and that becomes evident the moment you light it up. The spicy core of leather and cedar takes on some heady notes of coffee bean, earth and cinnamon, all the while filling the room with an enticing aroma. If you see a box, buy it.

The name is a reference to the cigar-making city Rodriguez's grandparents emigrated to, but his cigars aren't made in Tampa. They're made in Nicaragua at the Garmendia Cigar Co. factory.

H. Upmann,No. 2,98,$32.20,"It might be one of the best-kept secrets in the Cuban cigar world, as the typical Cuban cigar smoker tends to overlook the H. Upmann No. 2 for its more popular counterpart, the Montecristo No. 2. Because the two cigars are rolled in the same pirámide format, comparisons are going to be inevitable. Both share the exact same dimensions, but they don't have nearly the same star power. Some smokers tend to come around to Upmann after going through the more common Cuban standards, so it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call the H. Upmann No. 2 an insider's cigar. Nor would it be the first time that this cigar has made it to our Top 25 list, as we've often recognized it as a smoke of complexity, nuance and character. This year, we found the H. Upmann No. 2 to be the most exceptional cigar of 2022. Like many Cuban cigar brands that are still on the market today, H. Upmann has a long history that spans more than 178 years and has managed to thrive despite changes in ownership, bankruptcy and a political revolution that resulted in H. Upmann becoming property of the state. To say it's a survivor would be putting it mildly. The brand is an understated icon. H. Upmann was started in 1844 by German banker and financier Hermann Upmann, who had owned and operated a branch in Havana and manufactured cigars as well. His bank eventually went insolvent and H. Upmann was acquired by British distribution company J. Frankau & Co. In 1937, the brand ended up with Menendez y Garcia, the same company that produced Montecristos. The enormous success of Montecristo is what allowed Menendez y Garcia to keep the H. Upmann brand alive. When Fidel Castro nationalized the cigar industry in 1960, H. Upmann became property of the state and has been owned by the government ever since. Made in Havana, the H. Upmann No. 2 is sometimes misunderstood and dismissed as being too mild. It may not have been blended for strength, but smoking this cigar is a fully engaging experience with a room-filling aroma and mouth-filling texture that allows one to luxuriate in its layers of nutmeg, cinnamon and salted peanut flavor, all of which intensify, while, at the same time, showing a delicate floral quality that adds superb balance in a way that no other cigar this year could.",Medium,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/h-upmann-no-2-2022,,,,,,,,
Rocky Patel,Sixty Sixty,96,$18.00,"Rocky Patel loves to celebrate birthdays, milestones or anniversaries of any kind. So, when he turned 60 years old in 2021, nobody was surprised that Patel thought a new cigar was in order. In reality, he had been thinking about a 60th birthday project for quite some time. According to Patel, the cigars were already aged for two years before they were released, and it shows. Made in Nicaragua at his Tavicusa factory, the cigar is composed of Nicaraguan tobacco wrapped in a dark Mexican cover leaf from the San Andrés region. On paper, this combination of tobaccos isn't particularly uncommon, but two years in the aging room have given these cigars a cohesive elegance and refinement. Big and box-pressed, the Sixty resembles a chocolate bar, and Patel takes advantage of the large ring gauge by loading it with bold tobacco that lays down a foundation of leather and wood and continues to build in flavor with tasty layers of coffee, walnut and a ground red pepper spiciness. This cigar doesn't just represent Patel's six decades on earth, but also demonstrates how he's developed as a cigarmaker and how his understanding of raw materials continues to evolve.",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/rocky-patel-sixty-sixty-2022,,,,,,,,

Hoyo de Monterrey,Elegantes,95,$25.00,"Some cigars take the spotlight. Others fly under the radar. The Cuban Hoyo de Monterrey Elegantes is the latter, and it might be one of those smokes that you missed when perusing cigar shops around the world. To understand why, let's go back to 2016. It was the year that Cohiba turned 50 years old and Habanos turned all its attention to this flagship brand. At the Habanos Festival that year, the theme was overwhelmingly Cohiba.But on one of those nights, Habanos quietly introduced the Hoyo de Monterrey Elegantes. It was done so without fanfare or ceremony and simply included in a sampler pack. Its secondary band told us that the Elegantes was exclusive to La Casa del Habano franchise shops. The cigar was a bit of a head scratcher. This thin, old-fashioned figurado shape–known as tacos in Cuban cigar factories—wasn't particularly popular. And early releases were quite underwhelming. More current releases, however, proved to be outstanding. When we smoked the Elegantes this year, it gave us an entirely new, unexpected expression of the Hoyo de Monterrey brand. The tapers bring together notes of nutmeg, candied apple and vanilla in a concentrated way we don't find in Hoyo's rounder parejo shapes.",Medium,http://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/hoyo-de-monterrey-elegantes-2022,,,,,,,,
Oliva,Serie V Churchill Extra,95,$12.55,"The Oliva Serie V brand is a cigar that's consistently smoked above its price range since it was introduced in 2007, and the Churchill Extra here is no exception. As a company, Oliva can be chronicled in three major eras. It started modestly in 1995 producing inexpensive cigars. In the mid 2000s, the family-owned cigar manufacturer became serious about the premium sector, producing brands in its Nicaraguan factory such as the Serie O, and then the Serie V. Then, in 2016, after building a strong following in the cigar world, Oliva sold the company to another family, the Vandermarlieres of Belgium. Any worries about diminished quality have now been forgotten, as Oliva continues to make exceptional cigars under the leadership of Fred Vandermarliere, who vowed to maintain Oliva's record of excellence. From the beginning, Vandermarliere was clear that he had no interest in changing the company culture of Oliva. Every lively puff here of cinnamon, baked apple, nuts, raisin and minerals reminds us that he's kept his promise. It's a great smoke, but it's more than that. The Oliva Serie V Churchill Extra is also emblematic of how one great cigar family is able to carry on the high standards of another.",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/oliva-serie-v-churchill-extra-2022,,,,,,,,
Alec Bradley,Black Market Churchill,94,$10.25,"There is certainly a black market that exists in the cigar trade, but it usually has to do with tax evasion, contraband material or stolen goods. In the case of the Alec Bradley Black Market brand, the sinister-sounding name is more to get your attention. To hold your attention, brand owner Alan Rubin put together an unusual, but memorable blend. This dark cigar is made in Honduras by the Plasencias and covered in a Nicaraguan wrapper. A Sumatra-seed binder from Ecuador holds together a filler that's mostly Honduran, but there's another tobacco from one country that Rubin believes defines the cigar—Panama. While there's nothing illegal or illicit about Panamanian tobacco, it is unusual in the premium cigar world and brings a unique element to this Churchill that kept us interested and made it shine in this Top 25 contest. Like a good cocktail, however, the blend is balanced and no single tobacco speaks too loudly, though all do indeed get their say. Accents of dried herbs and smoked hickory highlight the rich, nutty smoke, which saturates the palate with every puff. Spice plays its appropriate part as well, occasionally bursting in the right places for a medium-to-full-bodied cigar that brings together the familiar with the exotic.",Medium-Full,https://www.cigaraficionado.com/ratings/24436/name/alec-bradley-black-market-churchill-churchill,,,,,,,,

La Gloria Cubana,Classic Glorias,92,$7.29,"This all started in Miami when La Gloria Cubana was a tiny brand, rolled in Little Havana with a small but loyal following. As La Glorias gained national recognition, tobacco corporation General Cigar took notice and bought the brand in 1997. Today, La Gloria Cubana is made in the Dominican Republic, but General treats it with reverence, and still proclaims La Gloria to be a boutique brand. A special rolling gallery within the large factory is dedicated only to the production of La Gloria. Many varieties of La Gloria Cubana now exist, but the original blend, with its Ecuador Sumatra wrapper, still impresses, showing a harmoniously nutty smoke atop an earthy core and fresh tobacco finish.",Medium-Full,http://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/la-gloria-cubana-classic-glorias-2022,,,,,,,,
Plasencia,Reserva Original Corona,92,$8.24,"It takes a bit of imagination to fully appreciate what the Plasencia family was hoping to achieve with this blend. According to the mission statement, this is the type of cigar that the Europeans would have smoked when tobacco was discovered in the New World more than five centuries ago. One can only speculate, but we'd like to think that this is a more refined product than what the Spanish colonials experienced. With a vast inventory of tobacco at their disposal, the Plasencias give us an all-Nicaraguan blend showing a toasty, nutty smoke accented by notes of orange peel, honey, almond paste and baking spices. Flavors resonate on the palate with a charming tea-and-cookie finish.",Medium,http://www.cigaraficionado.com/top25cigar/plasencia-reserva-original-corona-2022,,,,,,,,
